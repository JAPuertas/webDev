                    This is the first WEB APP that I made. It will contain things that I did and things I learn throught this programming experience. This will also contain stuff that I made and tips on how to be a real good web programmer.
               </p>
               <p> The programming languages that I will be using are the following.
                    <ul>
                         <li>HTML</li>
                         <li>CSS</li>
                         <li>JavaScript</li>
                    </ul>
                    I will develop this app and make it nice as a finish the tutorial. This will be the best web app ever!
